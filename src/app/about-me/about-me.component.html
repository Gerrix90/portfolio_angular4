		    <h1>About me</h1>
		    <p class="introduction">Frontend developer with about 1,5 years experience.
		    Still learning, increasing skills and getting better and better.</p>
		    <p>I started my adventure with programming 2 years ago, when I started doing online courses.</p>
		    <p>That was something that totally absorbed me. I spent every free moment on learning and creating small projects.</p>
		    <p>I decided to become a professional programmer and I pursue this goal step by step.</p>
		    <br>
		    <p>For last 14 months I was engaged in remote project where I worked with another developer. In this project I learned how to work in a group and be more independent.</p>
		    <p>Besides, of course, I increased my technical skills (more about it in section portfolio and skills).</p>
		    <p>It was my first remote job and it's definitely what I want to do. I have to be disciplined and Iâ€™m good at it. I have no problem with regularity and self-denial.</p>
		    <p>Thanks to remote work I save a lot of time as I don't need to commute to work and I can work from where I just want to be. And I love it.</p>
