		    <h1>About me</h1>
		    <p class="introduction">Frontend developer with about 1,5 year experience.
		    Still learning, increase skills and getting better and better.</p>
		    <p>I started my adventure with programming 2 years ago, when I started doing online courses.</p>
		    <p>That was something that totally absorbed me. I spent every free moment on learning and creating small projects.</p>
		    <p>I decided to become a professional programmer and realize this goal step by step.</p>
		    <br>
		    <p>For last 14 months I was engaged in remotely project. I worked with other developer. In this work I learned work in a group and be more independent.</p>
		    <p>Besides, of course, I increased my technical skills (more about it in section portfolio and offer).</p>
		    <p>It was my first remotely job and it's definitely that what I want to do. I have to be disciplined and Iâ€™m good at it. I haven't any problem with regularity and self-denial</p>
		    <p>Thanks to remote work, I save a lot of time to commute to work, and I can work from where I just want and I love it.</p>
